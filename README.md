# Wound-Analysis-Treatment-Planning
Analyze a 3D Scan of a patient wound &amp; present a treatment plan.

This script defines and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image segmentation. Specifically, it trains a model to segment wound regions in medical images.

The script first loads a dataset of segmented images, where the wound regions have been labeled. It then splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and preprocesses the images for training.

The CNN model is then defined using TensorFlow and Keras, and trained on the training set. The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance.

Finally, the trained model is saved to disk and loaded again for use on new, unseen images. The script includes code to process the model's predictions on new images and visualize the predicted segmentation masks.
